This project is the result of a set of trainings, workshops and presentations I prepared and presented to Java developers. It's about OO Programming, Java and JEE and I am releasing this material so you can benefit from it. You can benefit either by:

Studying it;
Discussing it in the google groups;
Taking the material and present it to your team.
You can join the group here: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/eujavatrainings

The source code is available, as well the slides. There is many material to cover. If you want to customize or improve the slides you can ask it in the group.

If you're reading the material or running the source code and find anything you believe is not correct, we can discuss in https://groups.google.com/d/forum/eujavatrainings
