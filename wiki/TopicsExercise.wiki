= Update the exercises folder and run tests=

Update your exercises folder from SVN
  
  * Go to {exercises_folder}/ejb31/mdb/topics
  * Generate the eclipse projects
    * {{{ mvn clean eclipse:eclipse -Dmaven.skip.test=true}}}
  * Start JBoss 7 and test the application
    * {{{ mvn clean install}}}

Tests will fail. That's your job to fix the application so all tests run

= Analyse tests and application =
  * In Eclipse, analyze project *remote-integration-tests*
  * Open class {{{OrdesRemoteFacadeTest}}} and analyse the test {{{testCreateOrder()}}}
  * Analyse also the *services* project

= Fix the application ==
  * Open file {{{OrdersService}}} and follow the *TODOs*
  * Open file {{{SellOrderNotifier}}} and follow the *TODOs*
  * Open file {{{SellOrdersTopicListener}}} and follow the *TODOs*
  * Open file {{{AverageOrdersTopicListener}}} and follow the *TODOs*
  * Open file {{{BigOrdersTopicListener}}} and follow the *TODOs*
  * Open file {{{SmallOrdersTopicListener}}} and follow the *TODOs*


  

After fixing the application and with the topic created, test the application:
  * {{{ mvn clean install}}}
